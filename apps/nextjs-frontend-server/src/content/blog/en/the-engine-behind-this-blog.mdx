## üöÄ Why [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

This blog runs on a <b>monorepo</b> that supports all the modern frontend frameworks‚Äî[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Astro](https://astro.build/), [Remix](https://remix.run/), [React](https://react.dev/), or [Vite](https://vite.dev).
I chose [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for its <b>speed</b>, <b>flexibility</b>, and <b>fullstack capabilities</b>. It‚Äôs a powerhouse for getting things built fast.
But I‚Äôm not locked in‚Äî[Astro](https://astro.build/) and [Vite](https://vite.dev) are on my radar for future iterations.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Why [Axum (Rust)](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum)

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) handles the frontend like a champ‚Äîbut backend? Not so much, especially when it comes to scaling and dealing with databases like [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/).

So I took a cleaner route: the <b>/api</b> routes are offloaded to [Axum (Rust)](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) via [RPC Bevy style](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy) , sitting behind a reverse proxy. Here's why that rocks:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is lightning-fast, memory-safe, and built for performance.
- [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) runs on [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/), making async tasks a
  breeze with work stealing.
- [Tower](https://github.com/tower-rs/tower) ecosystem gives me a powerful, modular service layer‚Äîperfect
  for backend logic.

Fast, safe, and built to scale.

## üê≥ Why Docker + [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

Containers are the backbone of this setup. Here's the deal:

- <b>No vendor lock-in</b> ‚Äî each service is containerized and deployable
  anywhere: serverless, cloud-native, Kubernetes, you name it.
- <b>Docker networks</b> make communication between services simple and
  efficient.
- <b>Kubernetes</b>? Too heavy for this blog. Docker Compose keeps things
  lightweight and easy to manage.

## üêò Why [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)

The backend is designed with <b>flexibility</b> and <b>performance</b> in mind‚Äîleveraging the power of [Axum (Rust)](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) as the service layer that connects everything behind the scenes.
Using [SeaQuery](https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-query) for expressive, type-safe queries and [SQLx](https://jmoiron.github.io/sqlx/) for blazing-fast, dynamic SQL execution, the system is built to work seamlessly with a wide range of databases and services:

- PostgreSQL (top pick üíô)
- MySQL
- MongoDB
- External services like Amazon RDS, Redis and S3

## üè° Why Self-Hosted with [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/)

This blog runs on my very own homelab ‚Äî and I love it.

- It‚Äôs a sandbox for me to grow my DevOps and cloud skills.
- I gave new life to an old 2013 MacBook with [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/).
- [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/) gives me secure, zero-cost egress‚Äîunlike cloud providers that nickel-and-dime you for traffic.
  Simple, cost-effective, and fun to build.

## üîê [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/) & [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) for Home Networking

Even at home, security matters.

- [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/) encrypts home traffic, because privacy should never be optional.
- [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) makes secure networking across all my devices effortless‚Äîplus, their free plan is generous.
  No more headaches. Just encrypted, seamless connectivity.
