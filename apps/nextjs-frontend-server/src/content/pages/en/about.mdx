## Who I am

I'm a Full Stack Engineer based in Vietnam, passionate about cutting-edge technologies like Axum (Rust), Next.js, React, Astro, Remix, Postgres, cloud-native, serverless, and self-hosted architectures.

Recently, I've been diving deeper into platform engineering, Rust-based backend, networking and infrastructure.

## What powers this site

- Frontend [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/):

  I chose Next.js for its fast, flexible, and stunning development experience — perfect for building modern, responsive UIs with ease and performance in mind.

- Backend [Axum (Rust)](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) & database [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/):

  The backend is built with Axum, a Rust-based web framework known for its type safety, security, and high performance. Acts as the dedicated service layer in front of the database — replacing the typical Node.js API — to deliver a consistent, reliable, and blazing-fast microservice architecture.

- Infrastructure [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com):

  This site runs on Proxmox, self-hosted on my old MacBook — a fun and budget-friendly way to sharpen my DevOps skills while keeping full control over the stack.

- Deployment: [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/):

  Built as a Docker Compose microservice stack, it's highly flexible and can be deployed on VPS, serverless platforms, or cloud-native environments with ease.

- CDN & Networking: [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/):

  Leveraging Cloudflared, the site is securely exposed to the internet with zero-cost egress, edge caching, and minimal overhead — I only pay for the domain.
