## Who I am

👋 Hi, I’m Nhat "Tiny" Vu — a Full Stack Engineer based in Vietnam.

I craft high-performance web apps with cutting-edge technologies like <b>Axum (Rust)</b>, <b>Next.js</b>, <b>React</b>, <b>Astro</b>, and <b>PostgreSQL</b>. Whether it’s <b>cloud-native</b>, <b>serverless</b>, or <b>self-hosted</b>, I build systems that are fast, scalable, and easy to maintain.

Recently, I've been diving deeper into <b>platform engineering</b>, <b>solution architect</b>, <b>Rust-based backend</b>, <b>networking</b> and <b>infrastructure</b>.

## What powers this site

- Open source, monorepo: [Github](https://github.com/NhatTinyVu/fusihub-web-app)

- Frontend: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)

  I chose Next.js for its fast, flexible, and stunning development experience — perfect for building modern, responsive UIs with ease and performance in mind.

- Backend: [Axum (Rust)](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) with [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/):

  The backend is built with Axum, a Rust-based web framework known for its type safety, security, and high performance. Acts as the dedicated service layer in front of the database — replacing the typical Node.js API — to deliver a consistent, reliable, and blazing-fast microservice architecture.

- Infrastructure: [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com) with VM

  This site runs on Proxmox, self-hosted on my old MacBook — a fun and budget-friendly way to sharpen my DevOps skills while keeping full control over the stack.

- Deployment: Docker with [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

  Built as a Docker Compose microservice stack, it's highly flexible and can be deployed on VPS, serverless platforms, or cloud-native environments with ease.

- CDN & Networking: Cloudflare with [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/)

  Leveraging Cloudflared, the site is securely exposed to the internet with zero-cost egress, edge caching, and minimal overhead — I only pay for the domain.
